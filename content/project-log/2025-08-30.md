I realize I’ve been talking about the GS3 a lot here, but getting to know it, I feel it might be useful to illustrate what the differences are between some high-end single group espresso machines. 

I’ll be comparing the Rancilio Silvia Pro X, the Lelit Bianca, the La Marzocco GS3 AV, and the La Marzocco Strada X. We’ll also be exploring what I call the ”reasonable moddable limit”. Technically, you can replace anything and everything in your machine with something from another machine, or something you’ve manufactured yourself, but at some point it’s not really the same kind of machine anymore. 

For this comparison, the ”reasonable moddable limit” is boilers and group. We won’t explore switching those out.

[^1]: Other configurations are of course possible, such as Gear pump + Gear pump, or a single gear pump and adding a solenoid valve
[^2]: Plumbing is impossible (or rather impractical) in *this* configuration, but not in all configurations
[^3]: On the Bianca, since the group is manually actuated, you can't truly stop the shot automatically. You can however run the pump at a very low flow.
[^4]: It is possible to add some form of input device to allow for manual flow profiling 
[^5]: If you have a gear pump in a Bianca, you can *either* control flow through the pump, or through the manual paddle. You shouldn't do both at the same time.
[^6]: With a custom controller you can just add whatever displays and inputs you want - e.g. a rotary encoder or a touch screen.
[^7]: Because the service boiler is used for preheating brew water, disabling the service boiler does affect brewing performance
[^8]: New GS3s have the cool touch wand, older ones can be retrofitted at significant expense
