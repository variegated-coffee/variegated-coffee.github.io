I realize I’ve been talking about the GS3 a lot here, but getting to know it, I feel it might be useful to illustrate what the differences are between some high-end single group, dual boiler espresso machines. 

I’ll be comparing the Rancilio Silvia Pro X, the Lelit Bianca, the La Marzocco GS3 AV, and the La Marzocco Strada X. We’ll also be exploring what I call the ”reasonable moddable limit”. Technically, you can replace anything and everything in your machine with something from another machine, or something you’ve manufactured yourself, but at some point it’s not really the same kind of machine anymore. 

For this comparison, the ”reasonable moddable limit” is boilers and group. We won’t explore switching those out.

Looking at the prices, it is sometimes hard to understand why e.g. you can get 13 Silvia Pro Xs for the price of a Strada X, and still have enough money left over to buy an okay grinder. A lot of the pricing is simply "because we can", but that's not to say that there aren't differences that's at least worth *some* money. You're mostly buying process improvments, repeatability and maintainability. Essentially, things that are critical if your espresso machine is a capital asset required for your business, but that are nice-to-haves in a home or even an office setting.

Still, some of the characteristics are quality-determining. As an example comparing the thermal stability between a Silvia Pro X, a Bianca and a GS3 - there is a noticable difference. Similarly, being able to pressure/flow profile (as on the Bianca and the Strada X), is essential for some types of shots. Some of these differences can be remedied by modding your machine, some can't.

I don't *recommend* anyone to mod their machine, but if you are an Enginista, you (like me) probably want to. Not only to get the best quality espresso possible, but also because you enjoy the process of making things. Modding your machine you get to explore the limits imposed by the fundamental architecture of your espresso machine, and push it right up to those limits. To some of us, that's just enjoyable. You can do that on any espresso machine, with good espresso as a result, but of course those limits are going to vary. Where you draw the line is up to you.

[^l58e]: It is a common misconception that the Bianca uses an E61 group. In fact, while it is E61 compatible, the group is a variation on the E61 design called L58E. The main difference is that it lacks the E61 preinfusion chamber and spring.
[^1]: Other configurations are of course possible, such as gear pump + vibratory pump, gear pump + gear pump, or a single gear pump and adding a solenoid valve
[^2]: Plumbing is impossible (or rather impractical) in *this* configuration, but not in all configurations
[^3]: On the Bianca, since the group is manually actuated, you can't truly stop the shot automatically. You can however run the pump at a very low flow.
[^4]: It is possible to add some form of input device to allow for manual flow profiling 
[^5]: If you have a gear pump in a Bianca, you can *either* control flow through the pump, or through the manual paddle. You shouldn't do both at the same time.
[^6]: With a custom controller you can just add whatever displays and inputs you want - e.g. a rotary encoder or a touch screen.
[^7]: Because the service boiler is used for preheating brew water, disabling the service boiler does affect brewing performance
[^8]: Newer GS3s have the cool touch wand, older ones can be retrofitted at significant expense
