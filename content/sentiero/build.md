## What is a Sentiero?

The Sentiero is Variegated Coffee's upgrade platform for the La Marzocco GS3, built around the APEC SoM and GS3 Carrier Board. While the base installation gives you modern espresso control, the real magic happens with the scenic routes - modular upgrades that let you customize your machine's capabilities.

This guide documents the available trails and how to implement them safely.

## Safety and Responsibility

Working inside an espresso machine involves mains voltage, high pressure, and high temperature systems. This modification requires:

- Understanding of espresso machine internals and safe service procedures
- Proper tools and safety equipment
- Comfort working with precision plumbing modifications
- Electrical safety knowledge for control system integration

This documentation reflects community experience, but every installation is unique. You're responsible for ensuring safe installation and operation in your specific machine and environment.

## Route A: Pressure Transducers

### Why Add Pressure Transducers?

Pressure monitoring transforms your brewing by providing real-time feedback on:
- Boiler pressure stability during extraction
- Preinfusion pressure profiles
- System health diagnostics
- Data for shot analysis and consistency improvement

### Technical Requirements

**Temperature Management:**
- Espresso boilers typically run 90-120°C
- Standard pressure transducers max out around 80°C
- Solution: Use 400mm capillary tubes for thermal isolation
- Alternative: High-temp rated transducers (more expensive, fewer options)

**Material Compatibility:**
- GS3 boilers: Stainless steel with brass fittings and copper tubing
- Critical: Avoid galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals
- Recommended: 316L stainless steel transducers with brass fittings
- **Warning:** Aluminum components will corrode in contact with brass/copper

**Electrical Interface:**
- GS3 Carrier Board expects: 5V supply, 0.5-4.5V output range
- Verify your transducer specifications match before installation

### Installation: Route A

**Required Components:**
- 2× Xidibei XDB401 pressure transducers (G 1/4", 316L SS, 5V supply)
- 2× Brass T-fittings (F-F-F, G1/4")
- 2× Brass 90° angle fittings (M-F, G1/4")
- 2× Brass straight nipples (M-M, G1/4")
- 2× Brass reducing nipples (G1/4" M to G1/8" M )
- 2× Capillary tubes (G1/8" to G1/4", 0.9×2×400mm)
- Loxeal 55-03 thread sealant (medium strength)
- AMPModu Mod II connectors for wiring

**Safety First:**
- Depressurize and cool the machine completely
- Work in a well-ventilated area when using thread sealant

**Installation Steps:**

*Per Boiler (repeat for both service and brew boilers):*

1. **Prepare the T-fitting assembly:**
   - Apply thread sealant to all connections
   - Thread the M-M nipple into the angle fitting
   - Thread the angle fitting into one side port of the T-fitting (making a fitting that instead looks like an F)
   - Thread the reducing nipple (1/4" to 1/8") into the center port

2. **Install the T-fitting:**
   - Carefully disconnect the existing capillary from boiler to manometer
   - Thread the T-fitting onto the boiler port (use appropriate torque)
   - Reconnect the manometer capillary to the available 1/4" port

3. **Connect the new capillary:**
   - Carefully coil the 400mm capillary (use copper bending springs if available)
   - Connect to the 1/8" port on the T-fitting
   - Route to a suitable location for the pressure transducer
   - Mount the transducer securely but accessibly

4. **Wiring:**
   - Route transducer cable to the electronics enclosure
   - Size cable appropriately (no excessive slack)
   - Terminate with AMPModu Mod II connector
   - Refer to GS3 Carrier Board documentation for pinout

**Testing:**
- Pressurize system gradually and check for leaks
- Verify pressure readings match existing gauges
- Test data logging functionality before regular use

### Troubleshooting

**Pressure readings seem incorrect:**
- Verify capillary connections are tight
- Check for air bubbles in the system
- Confirm transducer voltage and output range

**Leaks at T-fitting:**
- Verify proper thread sealant application
- Check thread engagement (don't over-tighten)
- Consider replacing seals/gaskets

**Electrical connectivity issues:**
- Check AMPModu connector seating
- Verify pinout matches carrier board documentation
- Test transducer power supply voltage

## Scenic Route B: Load Cell Grate and Gravity Integration

### Why Add Integrated Weighing?

Built-in weighing capabilities eliminate the need for external scales and enable:
- Automatic shot cutoff based on yield weight

2. **Cable preparation:**
   - Measure cable routing path from drip tray area to electronics enclosure
   - Determine the amout of slack you want in the cabling
     - You should be able to easily connect the grate to the machine, yet not have the connectors dangling too much
   - Cut PTFE tubing to appropriate length with some slack
   - Thread load cell cables through PTFE tubing for protection

3. **Magnetic connector installation:**
   - Solder one half of each magnetic connector cables to the load cell cables
   - **Critical:** Document wire color mapping at each connector
   - Test connections for continuity before proceeding

4. **Gravity board preparation:**
   - Configure Gravity board for your chosen connection method:
     - **Parallel connection (recommended):** Both load cells to single input channel
     - **Separate channels:** Individual load cells to separate input channels
   - Solder mating connector halves to Gravity board with appropriate wiring
   - Verify all connections match your load cell wire color documentation

5. **System installation:**
   - Mount Gravity board in electronics enclosure with adequate ventilation

### Configuration Notes

**Parallel vs. Separate Channel Connection:**
- **Parallel (recommended):** Simpler configuration, single weight reading, adequate for most applications
- **Separate channels:** Enables advanced features like tare detection, individual load cell monitoring, but requires more complex calibration

**Maintenance Considerations:**
- Magnetic connectors enable drip tray cleaning without tools
- PTFE cable protection extends service life in coffee shop environment
- Load cells should be protected from water ingress during cleaning
