## Dev Rig Carrier

The Dev Rig Carrier is intended for my own personal dev rig, a Rancilio Silvia that's been extensively modded with a gear pump, pressure transducer, flow meter, drilled-in temperature probe, 128x64px display and a rotary encoder. The Dev Rig Carrier doesn't focus on being compact, instead prioritizing hand-solderability and ease of development. It's designed to fit inside a Hammond Manufacturing 1593W case.

### Status
Project maintained, but not yet ready for release.

## Bianca with Gear Pump Carrier

The Bianca with Gear Pump Carrier is intended to support advanced hardware mods for the Lelit Bianca. Specifically, in addition to the standard Lelit Bianca hardware, it supports replacing the rotary pump with a gear pump, and adding two pressure transducers, up to two potentiometers, and a flow meter. It fits inside the standard Gicar enclosure.
