Variegated Coffee is on a mission to revolutionize espresso machines with open-source hardware and firmware. Our flagship products, the Open LCC and the All Purpose Espresso Controller, are designed to replace and enhance the electronics of existing machines, leveraging the power of RP2040 and ESP32-S3 microcontrollers.

Sustainability is at the heart of our project. By upgrading your espresso machine with our components, you can extend its lifespan and reduce electronic waste. Our solutions offer a more eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to buying a new machine.

Whether you're looking to integrate your espresso machine into your smart home, connect with Bluetooth peripherals, or create custom brewing routines, Variegated Coffee provides the tools and community to make it happen.

Variegate your espresso machine and elevate your coffee experience with Variegated Coffee!

## Why We're Doing This

### Passion for Hacking

At Variegated Coffee, we believe in two core principles: innovation and sustainability. Our passion for hacking and enhancing espresso machines drives us to create open-source solutions that offer more features and better performance than stock electronics. We love exploring the possibilities and sharing our discoveries with a community of like-minded enthusiasts.

### Commitment to Sustainability

Sustainability is equally important to us. Instead of discarding your espresso machine for a new one, upgrading its electronics and firmware is a more eco-friendly and cost-effective approach. Even when upgrades require new parts, such as a new type of pump, we'd much rather upgrade just that part than replacing the entire machine. By providing high-quality, open-source components, we enable users to extend the life of their machines, reducing electronic waste and promoting a more sustainable spare parts market. Our commitment to open hardware ensures that repair and modification are always possible, even when stock electronics fail.

Join us in our mission to innovate and make the most of the machines we love. Together, we can create a more sustainable and enjoyable coffee experience.
