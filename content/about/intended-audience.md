## Who This Is For

Variegated Coffee's open-source hardware projects are designed for the **"Enginista"** - that special hybrid of engineer and home barista who enjoys tinkering with both electronics and coffee equipment. If you're comfortable working with **microcontrollers**, understanding **circuit diagrams**, and aren't intimidated by the idea of carefully opening your espresso machine, these projects might be perfect for you.

**Coffee professionals** and dedicated Enginistas looking to **extend the life of their equipment** while adding modern features will find particular value here. Rather than replacing entire machines when electronics fail or when wanting advanced capabilities, our projects enable **sustainable upgrades** that enhance performance while reducing waste.

This approach requires **patience and curiosity** â€” you'll be learning about both your machine's internal workings and open-source hardware principles.

## What to Expect

It's essential to understand that these are **not commercial products**. None of our boards have **CE or FCC certification**, and they come with **no warranties or formal support structures**. Many components, like the **APEC SoM** and **Gravity weighing system**, are modules designed for integration rather than standalone devices.

As **open-source hardware**, you are responsible for:
- **Manufacturing the boards yourself** or arranging production with a PCB fabrication service
- **Sourcing components** and managing the supply chain
- **Assembly and testing** - all critical steps that require attention to detail and technical knowledge

## Safety Considerations

It's important to note that these projects involve working inside equipment containing **mains voltage components**, alongside **pressurized hot water systems**. While the control boards themselves operate at low voltage, they're installed in environments where **electrical safety knowledge is essential**.

If you understand **safe practices for working around high-voltage components** and are methodical in your approach to technical projects, you'll be well-equipped to implement these modifications.

## Community and Philosophy

The most successful adopters of Variegated Coffee projects tend to **enjoy the journey as much as the destination**. You'll be joining a community of **Enginistas** who share knowledge, troubleshoot challenges together, and continuously improve these open-source designs.

If you value **sustainability**, appreciate **customization possibilities**, and find satisfaction in understanding how things work, you've found your people.
