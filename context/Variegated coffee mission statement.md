# Variegated Coffee Mission Statement

At Variegated Coffee, we're on a mission to revolutionize espresso technology through open-source hardware and firmware that empowers both innovation and sustainability. We believe your coffee equipment should evolve with you, not be replaced.

We're committed to:

- Creating modular, adaptable solutions that extend the lifespan of existing espresso machines
- Developing open-source hardware that ensures repairs and modifications remain possible
- Building a community of enthusiasts who share designs and innovations
- Reducing electronic waste by upgrading components rather than replacing entire machines
- Making advanced espresso technology accessible to hobbyists, small manufacturers, and DIY enthusiasts

Through our innovative projects like the APEC SoM and Gravity weighing system, we're providing the tools and knowledge to transform espresso machines into customizable platforms that grow with your needs.

Join us in our passion for hacking, enhancing, and variegating your espresso experienceâ€”where sustainability meets innovation in every cup.
